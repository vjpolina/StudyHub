            <h4>What is StudyHub?</h4>
            <p> <b><i>StudyHub</i></b> is a project for students, by a student. After years of facing countless roadblocks when studying, 
                the creator of this web app was inspired to make something new, 
                something that could lessen the stress students are constantly under.<br>
                <p>The main demographic of the app are the ones who suffer from a short attention span, have trouble
                organizing their notes, or perhaps just need to have all their materials in front of them at once.
                The goal was to achieve a clean, simple and easy to use interface, with a few features to ease the process of studying.
                This being said, I will now explain the basic interface:<br>
                <b>1.</b> The "Login" page is not currently functional, but it's purpose is determined. This will allow you to acces 
                a personalized web page, rather than an account, therefore bypassing the need for a password. <br>
                <b>2.</b> The "Home" page is the main page of the app, where you will be able to create notes and upload any images you may require while 
                studying. Currently this is only possible with images saved in your storage. <br>
                <b>3.</b> The "Resources" page is where you can find a list of useful links to websites that may be helpful. <br>
                <b>4.</b> The "About us" page is where you are now, it contains  information about the app, the creator and eventually, information about updates. </p>
                <p>Keep in mind that the app is in it's demo phase. It is a long term project that will be updated continously, but patience will be appreciated, as this is a humble and independent work.<br>
